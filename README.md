Started this project for fun in 2019

This version of code is made to work in studio by default, the game files are also included.

For executor use, you may change the location of the menu. Believe this is commentated.

The FFA fix is meant for the ffa game file specifically, should work in most basic games but because this was meant for studio use i had to add a function (seen at bottom of FFA release).

All of this was made to work with default api, any executor.

Tried my best to include all the textures and other resources, might have lost track of some over the years.

Have fun trying to read this monster
